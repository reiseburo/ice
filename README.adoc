== Building/Testing

This project requires that you have at least JDK7 or later installed. It uses
link:http://gradle.org[Gradle] as its build tool which *should* resolve and
download all the necessary dependencies.

=== Running tests

`./gradlew check`

=== Building a release

`./gradlew assemble`

If `ice-server/build/distributions` you will find a `.tar` and `.zip` file which
should act as self-contained distributions with a start script for the server
